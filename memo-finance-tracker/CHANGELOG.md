## 1.4.0 - 2026-06-24

- **New – Vision AI for receipt scanning:** the optional on-device AI is now a
  small **vision** model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) that reads the **amount, date and
  merchant straight from the receipt photo**, instead of only cleaning up noisy
  text OCR. This is noticeably more accurate. The lightweight Tesseract OCR stays
  as a fast fallback for when the AI is off or still loading.
- **Changed – Local AI is now OFF by default:** the AI features are opt-in. The
  vision model is a sizeable download and is slow on weak hardware, so MEMO no
  longer enables it automatically. Turn it on in the add-on configuration or via
  **Settings → AI (local)**.
- **New – Enable-AI confirmation popup:** switching the AI on in **Settings** now
  shows a popup listing the **AI features**, the **system requirements**
  (~2.8 GB one-time download, ~4 GB RAM, modern AVX2 CPU) and an explicit warning
  that — depending on your hardware — loading the model and every AI action can
  take noticeably longer.
- **New – Install the AI model on demand, with a progress bar:** because the AI
  is off by default, the ~2.8 GB model is **only** downloaded the moment you
  enable it in **Settings** — keeping the initial add-on install fast and the AI
  a deliberate choice. While it installs, **Settings → AI (local)** now shows a
  real **progress bar** with a live percentage.
- **New – Helpful hints when AI is off:** the dashboard **AI Insight** card and
  the receipt-scan view now point you to **Settings** to enable the local AI for
  better results, instead of silently hiding the feature.
- **Docs – System requirements:** the README and add-on docs now describe the
  AI features and the hardware needed to run them locally.
- **Docs – Screenshots:** the README now includes a screenshot gallery (dashboard,
  transactions, projects, schedules, forecast, categories and settings) and the
  add-on docs show a few key screens.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-06-24

- **New – Full English / German interface:** the language switch in **Settings**
  now translates the *entire* app, including the reports, forecast, suggestion
  cards and receipt-scan messages — no more stray German labels in English mode.
- **New – Settings now sync across devices:** your **currency** and **language**
  are stored on the add-on (server-side) instead of only in the browser, so the
  Home Assistant Companion app shows the same € currency and language you set in
  the browser instead of falling back to defaults.
- **New – The expense forecast shows what's inside it:** every month in the
  forecast is now expandable to list the exact items it contains (fixed and
  variable schedules with how often they occur, plus planned project costs), and
  the chart tooltip breaks the total down by source.
- **New – Flexible forecast horizon:** choose **next month, 3, 6 or 12 months** —
  both the chart **and** the table now update together when you change it (the
  table previously stayed on the current month).
- **New – In-app receipt camera:** "Take photo" now opens a live camera inside
  the app with capture / retake / use, instead of only opening the gallery in
  the Home Assistant Companion app. (The Companion app must grant camera
  permission to its webview; the gallery/file picker remains as a fallback.)
- **New – Project origin on bookings:** bookings created from a project task now
  show a **project badge** in the bookings list.
- **Changed – Editing a project booking:** bookings that belong to a project task
  can no longer be edited directly (which previously reverted on the next sync).
  Editing one now opens a prompt that takes you straight to the project to change
  it there.
- **Fix – Receipt scan timeouts:** the receipt scan no longer fails with
  *"Zeitüberschreitung – Beleg konnte nicht gescannt werden"* on weak hardware.
  The optional on-device AI step is now time-boxed (returning the OCR result if
  it runs long) and the upload waits longer before giving up.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-06-24

- **New – Allocate project task costs to a category:** each project task can now
  be assigned a **category**. When the task is booked, its mirrored expense
  booking is filed under that category instead of always landing in *Other* — so
  the **Expenses by Category** report finally splits project costs correctly.
  Re-categorising a task re-files its booking; leaving it empty keeps the old
  *Other* default. Editing the booking's category by hand is still respected.
- **New – Estimated completion date for Kanban tasks:** Kanban task cards now
  have an **estimated completion date**, shown on the card while the task is
  still a forecast.
- **New – Projects appear in the Ausgaben-Forecast:** planned (not-yet-booked)
  task costs are now projected into the **expense forecast** in the month of
  their estimated completion date, with a dedicated *Projekte (geplant)* row in
  the next-month breakdown. Overdue-but-unbooked costs roll into the current
  month so they are never lost. (Tasks without a date are not time-forecast.)
- **Fix:** one of the icons in the icon picker was broken and showed a blank/
  replacement glyph; it now renders correctly.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-06-24

- **Fix – Project costs now flow into the rest of the app:** the cost of a
  **booked** task (a Kanban task in a *Done* column, or a Waterfall task whose
  planned end date has passed) is now mirrored into a real **expense booking**
  linked to the project. As a result those costs finally appear where you would
  expect them:
  - in the **Bookings** overview (and they count towards reports), and
  - in the **budget bar on the main Projects page**, which previously stayed at
    €0 even after a project's budget was allocated and tasks were booked.
  - Forecast (not-yet-booked) tasks stay out of your bookings; their planned
    amount is now shown as a **Forecast** badge on each project card, while
    booked amounts show as a **Booked** badge.
  - The mirrored bookings stay in sync automatically: moving a task in/out of a
    *Done* column, changing its cost, or a Waterfall end date passing all update
    or remove the booking. Deleting a task or project removes its booking too.
    The booking's category stays editable — re-file it and it will be kept.
- **Fix:** selecting an icon while creating or editing a project did not always
  apply (duplicate emoji entries collided in the picker); icon selection now
  works reliably, including from the search results.
- **Fix:** creating a project now opens it straight away so a new **Waterfall**
  (or Kanban) project is immediately visible and usable.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-06-23

- **New – Project management & cost control:** clicking a project now opens a
  full detail view that combines task planning with automatic forecast vs.
  actual cost tracking.
  - **Kanban mode:** organise tasks in freely configurable columns (default
    *To Do*, *In Progress*, *Done*). Drag tasks between columns or move them
    with the on-card arrows. A task's cost counts as a **forecast** until the
    task reaches a column flagged as *Done*, where it switches to **booked**
    (actual) cost.
  - **Waterfall mode:** give each task a planned start/end date and a cost.
    The cost stays a **forecast** while today is before the planned end date
    and automatically becomes **booked** once the end date has passed.
  - The project header shows forecast, booked, planned-total and the real
    amount already spent (from linked bookings) against the budget.
- **New – Bookings filters:** the bookings list can now be filtered by type,
  category, project and recipient / merchant.
- **New – Flexible time ranges:** browse bookings by **month, quarter or year**,
  or pick a **custom date range**; the activity heatmap on the projects page is
  now clickable and jumps to the bookings of the selected day.
- **Fix:** the *Bookings* page showed the round **+** button twice (the global
  quick-add button overlapped a page-local one); only the global one remains.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-06-23

- **Fix:** creating categories, projects, transactions and schedules failed
  behind Home Assistant ingress. The collection endpoints required a trailing
  slash and issued a 307 redirect whose absolute target dropped the ingress
  path, so the redirected request never reached the add-on. The endpoints now
  respond on the exact paths the UI calls — no redirect.
- **Fix:** the same redirect made category and transaction lists look empty,
  which is why *Suggested categories* and *Load demo data* appeared to do
  nothing and the *New category* / *New project* button showed up twice (the
  empty-state call-to-action stacked on the header button). All now behave.
- **Fix:** the bookings list ignored the month filter and pagination because
  the API used different query-parameter names; month navigation, the category
  filter and paging now work.
- **New:** a **Bookings** entry in the main menu opens the full transaction
  manager where every booking can be edited or deleted.
- **New:** clicking a slice or a row in *Reports → Expenses by Category* opens
  the bookings list filtered to that category.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-06-23

- **Settings → local AI toggle**: turn the embedded AI on or off at any time;
  the choice is persisted and the model is loaded/unloaded accordingly.
- **Settings → demo data**: one click loads a realistic ~3-month sample
  dataset (transactions, projects, schedules) and one click removes it again
  — only the demo entries are touched, never your own data.
- **Settings → suggested categories**: add a set of best-practice budgeting
  categories, or remove the unused ones again.
- **Embedded local AI** (optional, `ai_enabled`): Qwen2.5-0.5B runs inside the
  add-on for transaction auto-categorization, OCR cleanup and a monthly
  dashboard insight. No cloud, no Ollama; disable with `ai_enabled: false`.
- **Improved receipt scanning**: OpenCV pre-processing (grayscale, denoise,
  deskew, adaptive thresholding) plus separate **camera** and **file** actions.
- **CSV / PDF report export**, generated locally.
- **Version & build date** are now stamped from the build and shown under
  Settings → Info, with a direct link to the documentation.
- **Fix:** pin NumPy to the 1.26 line (and OpenCV to a matching build) so the
  add-on starts on older CPUs and on VMs with a generic CPU model, which
  previously crashed with `NumPy ... baseline optimizations (X86_V2)`.
- **Fix:** configure logging in Python instead of a uvicorn `--log-config`
  file, so a missing/invalid file can never stop the add-on from starting; all
  log lines now carry timestamps.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release of the **MEMO – Finance Tracker** Home Assistant add-on.
- Web UI served securely through Home Assistant **ingress** (no extra port).
- Optional **MQTT Discovery** sensors: income, expenses, balance and
  transaction count for the current month.
- MQTT credentials can be inherited automatically from the Home Assistant
  MQTT service (Mosquitto broker add-on).
- Persistent **SQLite** database stored on the add-on `/data` volume.
