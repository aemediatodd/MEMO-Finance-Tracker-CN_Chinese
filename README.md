# 💰 MEMO – Finance Tracker

### *own your finances*

**M**oney · **E**xpense · **M**anagement · **O**verview

A modern, lightweight, **local-first** personal finance tracker that runs as a
**Home Assistant add-on** — no cloud, no subscriptions, no telemetry. Everything
lives in a local SQLite database on your own hardware, and your key finance
metrics are published to Home Assistant as **MQTT sensors** for dashboards and
automations.

## ⚠️ Prerequisites

MEMO integrates with Home Assistant through **MQTT**. Before installing, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Home Assistant OS or Supervised** | Required to install add-ons. |
| **MQTT broker — [Mosquitto add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto)** | **Required.** Install *Mosquitto broker* from **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store** and start it. |
| **MQTT integration enabled** | **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → MQTT**, pointed at your broker. This is what turns MEMO's published topics into sensor entities via MQTT Discovery. |
| **MQTT user / credentials** | Create a Home Assistant user (or Mosquitto local user) for MEMO to authenticate against the broker. |

> Without a running MQTT broker (Mosquitto) and the MQTT integration, MEMO still works as a finance app, but **no Home Assistant sensor entities will be created**.

---

## 🤔 Why MEMO?

Most finance apps live in the cloud, share your data, and cost a monthly fee. MEMO is different. It runs on your own hardware, stores everything locally in SQLite, and integrates natively with Home Assistant — including single sign-on through the Home Assistant sidebar (Ingress). Your data never leaves your home.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Dashboard** – Real-time overview of income, expenses, balance and trends.
- **💸 Transactions** – Log income and expenses with category, recipient, payment
  method and notes. Filter by type, category, project, recipient and period
  (month / quarter / year / custom).
- **🔁 Schedules** – Manage recurring costs (rent, subscriptions, utilities) with
  fixed or variable amounts, plus **smart suggestions** that detect recurring
  patterns in your transactions and offer to turn them into schedules.
- **📁 Projects (Kanban & Waterfall)** – Plan work as a Kanban board or a
  Waterfall timeline, set a **budget**, and track **forecast vs booked** costs.
  Allocate each task's cost to a **category**, give Kanban tasks an **estimated
  completion date**, and have those planned costs flow into your expense forecast.
- **📈 Forecasting** – Automatic monthly, quarterly and yearly expense forecast
  from schedules, spending averages **and planned project task costs**.
- **🧾 Reports & Export** – Income/expense totals, monthly averages, biggest
  transactions, expenses by category, timelines, period comparisons and one-click
  **CSV / PDF export** (generated locally in your browser).
- **🏷️ Categories** – Fully customizable categories with icons and colors, plus a
  one-click set of **best-practice budgeting categories**.
- **📷 Receipt Scanning (OCR)** – Capture a receipt with your **camera** or pick an
  existing **image file**. Local Tesseract + OpenCV pre-processing auto-fills
  amount, date and recipient as a suggestion.
- **🧠 Embedded Local AI** *(optional, off by default)* – An on-device **vision**
  model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B) runs **inside the add-on** – no Ollama, no cloud. It reads
  the **amount, date and merchant straight from a receipt photo**, auto-categorizes
  new transactions and writes a short monthly insight. **Enable it from Settings**
  when you want it – a popup shows the system requirements first, and the ~2.8 GB
  model is then downloaded **on demand** with a live **progress bar**.
- **🧪 Demo data** – One-click **load/remove** of realistic sample data so you can
  explore every feature, removed again without touching data you created.
- **💾 Backup & Restore** – Download all your data as JSON and restore it again.
- **🛰️ MQTT Sensor Entities** – Key metrics published to Home Assistant via MQTT
  Discovery (see below).
- **🔐 Home Assistant Ingress** – Open MEMO straight from the HA sidebar;
  authentication handled by Home Assistant.
- **🌍 Multilingual** – German & English, with **light / dark** mode.

## �🚀 Installation

### Option A — one-click (recommended)

Click the button below to open your Home Assistant and add the MEMO repository,
then install the add-on from the store:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this add-on repository.](images/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Faemediatodd%2FMEMO-Finance-Tracker-CN_Chinese)

### Option B — manual

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Open the **⋮ menu (top-right) → Repositories**, paste this URL and click **Add**:
   ```
   https://github.com/aemediatodd/MEMO-Finance-Tracker-CN_Chinese
   ```
3. Find **MEMO – Finance Tracker** in the store and click **Install**.

### After installing

1. Make sure the **Mosquitto broker** add-on is installed and **running** (see
   [Prerequisites](#️-prerequisites)).
2. Open the MEMO **Configuration** tab and set your MQTT details (see below).
   Leave the username/password empty to inherit them from the broker add-on.
3. Click **Save**, then **Start** the add-on.
4. Check the **Log** tab to confirm it started cleanly.
5. Open the UI from the **sidebar** (Ingress) or the **Open Web UI** button.

> 💡 Home Assistant only rebuilds the add-on when the version changes. After an
> update isn't showing, use **⋮ → Check for updates** in the Add-on Store.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The add-on exposes the following options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_enabled` | `false` | Enable the embedded local **vision** AI (receipt reading, auto-categorization, monthly insight). **Off by default** — enabling it triggers a one-time ~2.8 GB model download (shown with a progress bar in **Settings → AI (local)**) and needs ~4 GB free RAM. Can also be toggled in **Settings**. |
| `mqtt_host` | `core-mosquitto` | Hostname of your MQTT broker. Use `core-mosquitto` for the official Mosquitto add-on. |
| `mqtt_port` | `1883` | MQTT broker port. |
| `mqtt_username` | – | MQTT username (a Home Assistant / Mosquitto user). |
| `mqtt_password` | – | MQTT password. |
| `mqtt_base_topic` | `memo` | Base topic MEMO publishes to. |
| `mqtt_discovery_prefix` | `homeassistant` | Home Assistant MQTT Discovery prefix. |
| `mqtt_currency` | `¥` | Currency unit used for the monetary sensors. |
| `mqtt_publish_interval` | `300` | How often (in seconds) metrics are re-published. |

The SQLite database is stored in the add-on's persistent `/data` volume and is included in Home Assistant backups.

---

## 📊 Home Assistant Sensor Entities

Once MQTT is configured, MEMO registers a **MEMO Finance Tracker** device with these sensors via MQTT Discovery:

```yaml
sensor.memo_income_this_month          # device_class: monetary
sensor.memo_expenses_this_month        # device_class: monetary
sensor.memo_balance_this_month         # device_class: monetary
sensor.memo_transactions_this_month    # count of transactions this month
```

These can be used directly in dashboards, history graphs and automations (e.g. "notify me when monthly expenses exceed €X").

---

## 🧠 Local AI (optional, 100% on-device)

MEMO can run a small embedded **vision** language model so smart features work **without any cloud service or separate Ollama container**. It is **off by default** — turn it on in the add-on configuration or via **Settings → AI (local)** (a popup shows the system requirements first).

- **Model:** Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (GGUF, Q4_K_M, ~1.9 GB) plus its vision encoder / mmproj (~850 MB), running via `llama.cpp` on CPU.
- **First enable:** the model is downloaded **on demand** — only the moment you switch the AI on — into the persistent `/data/models` volume, with a live **progress bar** in **Settings → AI (local)**. This keeps the initial add-on install fast and makes the AI a deliberate choice. This is the **only** time MEMO touches the network for AI; all inference happens locally afterwards. The download runs in the background and never blocks the app.
- **What it does (the AI features):**
  - **Receipt scan (OCR)** – reads the **amount, date and merchant directly from a receipt photo** with the vision model. Far more accurate than plain text OCR.
  - **Auto-categorization** – when you add a transaction without picking a category, the model suggests the best-matching one (falling back to a default if unsure).
  - **Monthly insight** – an "AI Insight" card on the dashboard summarizes the last 30 days in two or three sentences with one saving tip.
- **Without AI:** receipt scanning still works using the lightweight **Tesseract OCR + regex** fallback (no big download, fast even on weak hardware); categorization falls back to a default and the insight card simply invites you to enable AI.
- **Disable it:** set `ai_enabled: false` in the add-on configuration, or use the **AI (local)** toggle under **Settings**. Every AI feature then degrades gracefully and the rest of the app keeps working.

---

## ⚙️ System requirements for the AI features (local)

The on-device AI is optional and **off by default**. To turn it on, your Home Assistant host should meet roughly these requirements:

| Resource | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Free RAM** | **~4 GB** free for MEMO | The 3B vision model needs ~3.5 GB resident while loaded. |
| **CPU** | 64-bit, modern (**AVX2**) | Runs CPU-only. On a Proxmox VM set the CPU type to **host** so AVX2 is available — otherwise inference is much slower (or the model may fail to load). |
| **Disk** | **~3 GB** free in `/data` | One-time download (model ~1.9 GB + vision encoder ~850 MB), stored in `/data/models`. |
| **Network** | once, for the download | Only the first-time model download; all inference is then 100% local / offline. |

> ⏱️ **It can be slow.** Depending on your hardware, the **first model load** and **every AI action** can take noticeably longer — on weak CPUs (few cores, no AVX2) up to **a minute per receipt**. If the receipt-scan AI step exceeds its time budget, MEMO automatically falls back to the fast Tesseract OCR result. If your hardware is limited, simply keep the AI features **off**.

## 📁 Project management (Kanban & Waterfall)

Open any project to plan and cost out larger goals (a renovation, a trip, a build):

- **Two modes** – a **Kanban** board (To Do / In Progress / Done columns with
  drag & drop) or a **Waterfall** timeline sorted by date.
- **Budget & cost tracking** – set a project budget and watch the bar fill as
  costs move from **forecast** (planned) to **booked** (actual).
- **Booked costs become real bookings** – when a task is *done* (Kanban) or its
  end date passes (Waterfall), its cost is mirrored into a normal **expense
  booking**, so it shows up in Transactions, Reports and the budget bar.
- **Category allocation** – give each task a **category**; its booked cost is
  filed there instead of a generic "Other", keeping *Expenses by Category* useful.
- **Time-based forecast** – give a task an **estimated completion date** and its
  planned cost is projected into the **expense forecast** for that month.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | FastAPI (serves both the REST API and the built frontend) |
| Database | SQLite (local, in `/data`) |
| OCR (fallback) | Tesseract via pytesseract + OpenCV pre-processing + Pillow |
| Local AI (optional) | llama.cpp (`llama-cpp-python`) + Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct GGUF (vision) |
| Pattern Matching | rapidfuzz |
| HA Integration | MQTT Discovery (paho-mqtt) + Ingress |
| Auth | Home Assistant (via Ingress) |

The add-on runs as a **single container**: FastAPI serves the compiled React app and the API on one port, which Home Assistant exposes through Ingress.

---

## 💻 Development / Standalone

MEMO can also run outside Home Assistant for development.

**Docker (standalone):**
```bash
docker compose up --build
# frontend: http://localhost:3000   backend: http://localhost:8000
```

**Local dev (hot reload):**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api to :8000)
```

To enable MQTT in standalone/dev mode, copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set `MQTT_HOST` (and credentials). If `MQTT_HOST` is empty, the MQTT feature stays disabled and the app runs normally.

---

## ✅ Tested environments

MEMO's interface is actively tested on:

- **Google Chrome** (desktop)
- **Microsoft Edge** (desktop)
- **Home Assistant Companion app** (Android)

Other modern browsers are expected to work but are not regularly tested. The
in-app receipt camera requires camera permission to be granted to the Home
Assistant Companion app's webview.
